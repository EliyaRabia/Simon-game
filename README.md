# Simon-game
The old classic Simon game.

Rules:
The game has 4 colors and at the beginning, the computer chooses one color
(by playing a unique sound and blinking for each color), then it is the user's turn to click on that color.
If the user is right, he will go to the next step where the computer will add a new color and
the user has to press the entire sequence of colors up to that step inclusive.
